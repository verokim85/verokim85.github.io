I struggled through nested hashes.  The concepts were pretty easy when reading the sections however, completing the labs were another story.  I had to tap into various resources available on learn.co and google in order to become adept in hashes and solve the lab problems.  I had to review the concepts over the course of several days in order to make sure that I truly understood the concepts of hashes since they play a large role in programming.  One of the major struggles I had with hashes was being able to look at the various layers within the hashes in order to access and manipulate the correct one.  I allowed myself time to read and absorb the information while also playing around in the irb.  After processing through the information I was not only able to solve the labs, I understood hashes!
