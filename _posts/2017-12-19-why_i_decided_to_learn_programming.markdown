  I've worked as an Occupational therapist for the past 7 years.  Although it is a very rewarding field, at this stage in my life I want something new.  How I came across programming is that one day I decided to picked up an HTML book that was lying around in my house and began to read it.  Although I wasn't able to decipher the codes at first, I kept at it.  Slowly but surely I was able to read and understand the text before me.  It was exciting, new and fun.  After a few months of tinkering around with HTML and CSS, I decided to turn my hobby into my future by enrolling into Flatiron school.       
 What excites me is technology.  It is advancing at a fast pace and I am amazed at the power it has to change a culture.  For instance, we can use technology to program artifical intelligence to improve the efficiency and safety in the workplace.  It can be used to connect doctors and patients for improved medical care.  In addition, we can also use it as a platform for people to connect via apps such as twitter, facebook, snapchat etc.  Technology is the future and it's only going to continue grow and expand.  I am passionate about this field and can't wait to be a part it.
