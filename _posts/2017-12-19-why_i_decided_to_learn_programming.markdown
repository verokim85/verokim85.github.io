I wanted to challenge myself and do something different with my life.  Currently I work as an Occupational therapist.  It's a great job however, after 7 years of devoting myself to this field I decided that this just wasn't for me anymore.  I wanted a brand new start with a new slate and really delve into something that I haven't done before.  One day I decided to open up an HTML book that was lying around in the house (thanks to hubby) and started teaching myself coding.  At first I thought, "this is like reading a bunch of hieroglyphics, I don't get it"  However the more I read, the more I understood that there was meaning to what I was reading (duh).  After I got a sense of how things worked, I decided to write my codes and make a mini website for myself.  It took a while but once I got it to work it was the most exciting thing ever!!  It was at that moment I decided to become a programmer!  I mean why not, coding is THE future.  With everything getting automated and the use of electonic devices becoming more prevalent, it's like joining the winning team.  I'm excited to be learning how to code and can't wait to work in this field.
