  I've worked as an Occupational therapist for the past 7 years.  Although it is a very rewarding field, at this stage in my life I want to try something new.  How I came across programming is that one day, I decided to picked up an HTML book that was lying around in my house and began to read it.  I wasn't able to decipher the codes at first, but I kept at it.  Slowly, I was able to read and understand the text before me.  It was exciting, new and fun.  After a few months of tinkering around with HTML and CSS, I decided to turn my hobby into my future by enrolling into Flatiron school.       

 What excites me is technology.  I am amazed at how quickly it's advancing and the ability it has to change a culture.  For instance, we can use technology to program artifical intelligence to improve efficiency and safety in the workplace.  It can be used to connect doctors and patients for improved medical care.  In addition, social media can be used to connect people.  I am excited about the advances that technology is continually making and can't wait to be a contributing member.
