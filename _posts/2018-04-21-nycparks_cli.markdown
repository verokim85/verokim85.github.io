The NycParks CLI provides the user with the ability to obtain information on a specific park chosen by the user.  The information provided consists of the park's name, address, borough and park info. 

I learned a lot from this project.  It really taught me about the importance of organization and how to properly scrape, design and use logic.  Many hours went into creating this CLI.  In order to help me get started with this project, I've watched and rewatched many of the CLI gem tutorials like the walkthroughs, anti-pattern and refactoring videos.  I've also had to review my notes many times as a refresher for particular topics.  

Although it was frustrating at times, there were also moments of breakthroughs which made it worth it.  I'm very pleased with the results of my first project.  Although it may not be the prettiest, I was able to accomplish everything that I've planned.  This project provided a great learning experience that helped to bring together all the elements we've learned up to this point.
